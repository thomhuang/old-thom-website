These <a href="https://github.com/thomhuang/thomhuang.github.io-pic16/" target="_blank">instructional blog posts</a> are various posts/markdown pages representing me giving a "lesson" through blog form of how to do various tasks in Data Science in PIC 16B at UCLA. I utilized Python and its packages to work through these lessons. There are four main blog posts, each numbered by date created.

## <a href="/projects/instructional_blogs/blog-post-zero/" target="_blank"> Blog Post 0 </a>

I used `pandas` alongside `seaborn` and `pyplot` from `matplotlib` in order to create a visualization of penguin data (containing species, region, measurements, etc.).

## <a href="/projects/instructional_blogs/blog-post-one/" target="_blank"> Blog Post 1 </a>

I worked with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admistration's (NOAA) climate [data set](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-monthly-version-4), which contains detailed records of surface temperatures at many atmospheric measurements stations across the globe. Overall, I:

1. Created a database with three tables containing information from three data sets with `pandas`
1. Created a query function utilizing our database with `SQLite3`
1. Created a geographic plot describing yearly temperature changes with `plotly`

## <a href="/projects/instructional_blogs/blog-post-two/" target="_blank"> Blog Post 2 </a>

This blog post aims to explain how to create a simple version of a spectral clustering algorithm for clustering data points with linear algebra utilizing `numpy` and `pyplot`.

I work toward answering the question:

> When detecting fake news, is it most effective to focus on only the title of the article, the full text of the article, or both?

using `Tensorflow` and developing our own machine learning model to see what is most effective.
