# **WORK IN PROGRESS, DOES NOT LINK TO BLOG POSTS YET.**

These <a href="https://github.com/thomhuang/thomhuang.github.io-pic16/" target="_blank">instructional blog posts</a> are various posts/markdown pages representing me giving a "lesson" through blog form of how to do various tasks in Data Science with python and its packages from my enrollment in PIC 16B at UCLA. There are four main blog posts, each numbered by date created.

## Blog Post 0

I used `pandas` alongside `seaborn` and `pyplot` from `matplotlib` in order to create a visualization of penguin data (containing species, region, measurements, etc.).

## Blog Post 1

I worked with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admistration's (NOAA) climate [data set](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-monthly-version-4), which contains detailed records of surface temperatures at many atmospheric measurements stations across the globe. Overall, I:

1. Created a database with three tables containing information from three data sets with `pandas`
1. Created a query function utilizing our database with `SQLite3`
1. Created a geographic plot describing yearly temperature changes with `plotly`

## Blog Post 2

This blog post aims to explain how to create a simple version of a spectral clustering algorithm for clustering data points with linear algebra utilizing `numpy` and `pyplot`. 

## Blog Post 3

I work toward answering the question:

> When detecting fake news, is it most effective to focus on only the title of the article, the full text of the article, or both?

using `Tensorflow` and developing our own machine learning model to see what is most effective.
