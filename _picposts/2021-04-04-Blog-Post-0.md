### Creating Penguin Data Visualizations!

By the end of this blog post, we should have successfully showed how to visualize the correlation between different penguin species' body mass (g) vs flipper length (mm) between each species using various packages.

## 1. Introducing the packages and data

We will be using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) alongside [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and `pyplot` from [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) in order to create a visualization of penguin data. In particular, we will use `pandas` to retrive and manipulate the data we need, `seaborn` to create the visualizations, and `pyplot` in order to change the legend and save the figure.

To give a bit of context about the data, the [GitHub page](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) says the goal of the data is to provide a great dataset for data exploration & visualization. It contains information such as the penguin's species, its region/island, culmen length, flipper length, etc. 

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">
You may be familiar with `pandas` and `matplotlib`, but may be unfamiliar with `seaborn`. `Seaborn` is simply a Python data visualization library based on `matplotlib`, which provides a more convenient way to create high-level interfaces for statistical graphics.
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

First we'll import the necessary packages, as well as the data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

And the dataframe is previewed (not in its entirety) below:

## 2. Cleaning the dataframe and getting the needed info

Now, we are going to remove any information that won't be relevant to our visualization. As we want to see the correlation of flipper length vs body mass per species of penguin recorded, we'll only keep the columns that contain species name, flipper length, and its body mass.

Furthermore, the full species name of the penguins are a bit long so we edit the column so that we only have its name:

```python
penguins = penguins[["Species", "Flipper Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)"]]
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split(' ').str[0]
```

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">
`penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split(' ').str[0]`

The given dataframe contains the species name in format: 
```
name penguin (species)
```
and we only want the name itself.

To achieve this, we interprets the column as type string, splits the string between its spaces into an array, and finally takes the first entry of each array and replace the full species name with just the name.
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

The edited dataframe is shown below:

![edited_df.png](/assets/images/pic16b-posts/edited_df.png)

In the figure above, we can see that row 339 has values `NaN`, and we'll remove them all as they don't provide any useful information:

```python
penguins = penguins.dropna(axis = 0, how = 'any')
```

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="got-help">

`axis = 0` chooses to remove the row, and `how = 'any'` removes all `NaN`s. Information on other possible paremeters is [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html).

</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

In the new dataframe, we can see that row 339 has been removed:

![nan_removed.png](/assets/images/pic16b-posts/nan_removed.png)

Now that we've finally gotten the dataframe to an acceptable state, it is time to finally use `seaborn` and `pyplot` to plot.

## 3. Plotting the Data

Seaborn houses many different ways to plot data whether it be categorical data, regressions models, statistical relationships, etc. In this case I decided to go with a `scatterplot` as it seemed most appropriate to visualize the data.

Moreover, I played with the legend a bit changing the location, font, and box visuals which is shown below:

``` python
    curr = sns.scatterplot(data = penguins, 
                    x = "Flipper Length (mm)", 
                    y = "Body Mass (g)", 
                    hue = "Species", 
                   style = "Species",
                   palette = "bright")
    plt.legend(loc = 'upper left', shadow = True, fontsize = 'large')
```

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="gave-help">

The plotting is relatively simple, so if you'd like to put your own spin/additions to the plot, here is the documentation for both the [scatterplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.scatterplot.html) and [legend](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.legend.html) functions.

The most simple plot for our purposes would only require:
 * `data = ___`: specify the set of data 
 * `x = ___`: specify what column from the data you want as the x-axis
 * `y = ___`: specify what column from the data you want as the y-axis
 * `hue = ___`: specify what column from the data you want to populate the legend

 I had `style` (you specify the vector) which gives different data point styles for each category in the legend and `palette` (options shown below) which  changes the color palette of the data points.

</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

And below is the final plot. Hopefully this was clear and informative!
