### Working with Climate Data with Pandas and SQLite3

## 1. Introducing the data and packages 

In this blog post today, we are going to work with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admistration's (NOAA) climate [data set](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-monthly-version-4), which contains detailed records of surface temperatures at many atmospheric measurements stations across the globe. Overall, we will:

1. Create a database with three tables containing information from three data sets
1. Create a query function utilizing our database
1. Create a geographic plot describing yearly temperature changes

according to what is wanted by the problems. Today, we are going to work with this data, and namely with databases with regard to atmospheric stations, the countries they're located in, and finally their temperature values.


We will be using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) in order to manipulate the data and create dataframes, [sqlite3](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-python/) to execute our SQL commands, as well as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html), [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/?v=20210412171704), and [plotly express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) to plot our visualization.

<div class="got-help">

If you aren't too familiar with databases, a [database](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/) is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 

Generally, [SQL (Structured Query Language)](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/) is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control.

</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

## 2. Getting our Data into our Database

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="gave-help">

In order to even manipulate our database we need to create a `Connection` to it, which is why we call `conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")`.

`conn` is what we call our assigned `Connection` to the database we call `temps.db`. 

If `temps.db` doesn't exist already, it will create it in the same directory.

</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

from plotly import express as px
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

import calendar #used to convert from month number to month string

conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
```



So now, we are finally good to populate our database. As we said above, we need to create and add tables corresponding to the data for the `countries`, `stations`, and `temperatures`. We will read in the data using pandas, as well as converting them to tables and adding them into our database.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">

If you are not aware, [tables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/tables?view=sql-server-ver15) are database objects that contain all the data in a database. 

In tables, data is logically organized in a row-and-column format similar to a spreadsheet. Each row represents a unique record, and each column represents a field in the record.

</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="gave-help">

Documentation for [`to_sql()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html) can be found here.

To briefly explain the parameters:
* `countries` : specify the table name
* `conn` : specify the `Connection`
* `if_exists = ____` : `fail`, `replace`, or `append` repeat values
* `index` : chooses whether we write DataFrame index as a column

</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

So below we will import all needed data:

```python
countries_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(countries_url)
countries = countries.rename(columns = {"FIPS 10-4"  : "FIPS"}) # We rename the column for convenience
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

</table>
<p>279 rows × 3 columns</p>
</div>

We can see the `countries` table contains information pertaining country names, as well as their country codes.

```python
stations_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(stations_url)
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
stations
```

The stations table contains the station ID, station name, its location in latitude/longitude, and its elevation.

In terms of our `temperatures` data, we want to clean up the data a bit to remove unnecessary information as it will make it easier on ourselves to retrieve the data later. 


```python
def prepare_df(df):
    df["FIPS"] = df["ID"].str[0:2] #Creates a new column corresponding to the station's country's code
    
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year", "FIPS"]) #Sets our indexing
    df = df.stack() #Creates a multi-level index dependent on the above
    df = df.reset_index() #Reverts to normal column indexing in the same order as above
    
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_3"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"}) #Renames column appropriately
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int) #Change the month column to reflect the integer value of the month
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100 #Converts from a hundreths of a Celsius to whole Celsius
 
    return(df) #Returns our dataframe
```
And now, we are going to want to convert our dataframe into a table in our database. As our `temps.csv` file is quite large and not all computers can load in the data efficiently or swiftly, it's better to load it into chunks as opposed to in its entirety. This is exactly what the below does:

```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df)
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)
```

Now in order to access the information in our database, we must use something called a `Cursor` on our `Connection` made earlier. The `cursor` interacts with our database and executes the SQL commands. There are many cheat sheets that contain the SQL commands such as one [here](https://github.com/enochtangg/quick-SQL-cheatsheet).

</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

Below is an example of declaring our cursor, as well as using SQL commands to see what tables populate the database. 


```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")
print(cursor.fetchall()) #fetchall() returns a list containing all the items returned
```

```
    [('countries',), ('stations',), ('temperatures',)]
```

As one can see, it contains tables, `stations`, `countries`, and `temperatures`. Similarly, the below lists the columns in each table as well as their predicted type:

```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")

for result in cursor.fetchall():
    print(result[0])

```

```sql
    CREATE TABLE "countries" (
    "FIPS" TEXT,
      "ISO 3166" TEXT,
      "Name" TEXT
    )
    CREATE TABLE "stations" (
    "ID" TEXT,
      "LATITUDE" REAL,
      "LONGITUDE" REAL,
      "STNELEV" REAL,
      "NAME" TEXT
    )
    CREATE TABLE "temperatures" (
    "ID" TEXT,
      "Year" INTEGER,
      "FIPS" TEXT,
      "Month" INTEGER,
      "Temp" REAL
    )
``` 

Now that we are done writing into our database, we are going to want to close our connection to it by calling `conn.close()` where `conn` is your `Connection` object. This is for the purpose of safe coding to explicitly make sure that the code was able to finish and close gracefully. Now that we have all the information we need, can write our query function!

## 3. Writing a Query Function

Looking at the query function itself, you can see the difficulty lies more in *knowing* what information you need and how to access it as the code itself is relatively short.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="got-help">

Our query function takes in four parameters:
* country name
* earliest year in which the data to be taken
* oldest year in which data to be taken
* the month in which the data was taken

To explain the SQL commands:
* `SELECT` : what columns are to be displayed
* `FROM` : from what table are we looking at
* `LEFT JOIN` : Coorresponds data from matching values in table
* `WHERE` : specify restrictions to data shown

Note that when we specify what data we want, our parameters aren't static so we must pass the desired parameters in through what we called `param` into our `read_sql_query()` function.

</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db") #Connects to our database
    
    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.Country, T.year, T.month, T.temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C on T.fips = C.fips
    WHERE C.Country = "{country}" AND T.year >= {year_begin} AND T.year <= {year_end} AND T.month = {month}
    """
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    
    conn.close() #closes our connection to our database
    
    return df
```

What our query function does specifically is takes data specific to the parameters and displays it in a dataframe. An example of its use is shown below alongside its output:


```python
query_climate_database(country = "India", 
                       year_begin = 1980, 
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
```

## 4. Writing a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases

Now, using the query function we wrote above, we will be able to create a geographic scatter to answer the following question:

> How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country? 

Below is our function:

```python
def coef(data_group):
    x = data_group[["Year"]]
    y = data_group["Temp"]  
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return LR.coef_[0]

def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
        
    count_year = df.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(len)
    mask = (count_year >= min_obs)
    df = df[mask]
    
    coefs = df.groupby(["NAME", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    coefs = coefs.rename(columns = {0 : "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"})
    
    coefs["Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"] = coefs["Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"].round(4)
    
    mydate = datetime.datetime.now()
    
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(coefs, 
                            lat = "LATITUDE", 
                            lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                            hover_name = "NAME",
                            hover_data = ["Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"],
                            color = "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)",
                            title="Estimates of yearly temperature increases in " + calendar.month_name[month] + f" for stations in {country}, years {year_begin}-{year_end}",
                            **kwargs)
    return fig
```

Although the function is a bit lengthy and confusing, it isn't that bad in reality. The first thing you would probably notice is the `coeff(data_group)` function. This was created in accordance to computing the first coefficient of a linear regression model at each station shown somewhere [here](https://github.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/blob/master/lectures/EDA/pd-2.ipynb)

Then, we finally start writing our geographic scatter function.

Of course, we are going to have to read in the data, and the query function we made earlier works perfectly. 

The next lines of: 

```python
    count_year = df.groupby(["NAME"])["Year"].transform(len)
    mask = (count_year >= min_obs)
    df = df[mask]
```

utilizes the parameter `min_obs`. We use the `transform()` function alongside `len` to retrieve how many years are recorded on the `"Year"` column for each station from the `"NAME"` column, where any value a part of the dataframe with `len ≤ min_obs` is removed from the dataframe.

The next lines manipulating `coefs` are shown below:

```python
    coefs = df.groupby(["NAME", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    coefs = coefs.rename(columns = {0 : "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"})
    coefs["Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"] = coefs["Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"].round(4)
```

What we do here is assign a new dataframe, `coefs`, after calling `groupby` and `apply`ing the `coef` function we saw previously.

After the dataframe has been created, we don't care about the indexing so we reset it, as well as renaming the columns and rounding to four decimal places.

Now, with 

```python
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(coefs, 
                            lat = "LATITUDE", 
                            lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                            hover_name = "NAME",
                            hover_data = ["Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"],
                            color = "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)",
                            title="Estimates of yearly temperature increases in " + calendar.month_name[month] + f"<br> for stations in {country}, years {year_begin}-{year_end}",
                            **kwargs)
```

This creates a geographic plot dependent on latitude and longitude values given. To explain the parameters:

* `coefs` : this is our dataframe
* `lat` and `lon` : specify columns that contain latitude and longitude data
* `hover_name` : what name identifies the data point when hovered over
* `hover_data` : what information is included outside of name, latitude, and longitude
* `color` : specifies what populates the legend
* `title` : specifies what you want the title to be
* `**kwargs` : Any other additional arguments given my user

And we are done! Below is an example of how to pass in parameters as well as the plot:

```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap

fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)

fig.show()
```

{% include example_mapbox.html %}

And thus we are done with our geographic plot!

Now that we have learned about how to query and create visualizations with our database, we'll show some interesting plots made with the same database to hopefully inspire you to make your own.

## 5. First Plot

The question that we will be answering in our first plot is:

> How has the average temperature change between certain months in a given country?

Of course, we won't be entirely accurate as our data only contains temperatures recorded by the various stations, but we can get a general idea of how they have changed, and we can see how the seasons affect countries throughout the year.

So we are going to have to query the database created earlier to obtain the information that we need! As we've explained the general idea of how to query, you can explore on your own and utilize `pandas` and `Plotly Express` to manipulate the data, as well as plot it beautifully.

```python
import numpy as np
def query_avg_temp(country, month_begin, month_end, year_begin, year_end):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db") # Connect to our database
   
    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.name, C.country, T.month, T.year, T.temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C on T.fips = C.fips
    WHERE C.country = "{country}" AND T.month >= {month_begin} AND T.month <= {month_end} AND T.year >= {year_begin} AND T.year <= {year_end}
    """
   
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn) # Creating a dataframe with our desired information
    
    df = df.groupby(["Year"])["Temp"].aggregate(np.mean) # Change our dataframe to display the mean temperature by year
    df = df.reset_index() #Take out the indexing so we get our Year and Temperature columns
    
    # Here, we are just plotting a line plot with Plotly Express

    fig = px.line(df, 
                     x="Year", 
                     y = "Temp", 
                     labels = {"Temp" : "Average Temperature (C)"}, 
                 title = f"Average temperature (C) in {country} between <br>" + 
                 calendar.month_name[month_begin] + " and " + calendar.month_name[month_end] + 
                  ", " + str(year_begin) + "-" + str(year_end))
    fig.update_traces(mode = "markers + lines") #Makes our plot have data points in addition to a line plot
    
    return fig #of course, we return our figure in the end
```

Now that we have our query + visualization function written, let us show an actual example of it! We will using India again just as the geographic plot, but instead we will show its changes throughout the year between 1990 and 2010.

```python
fig = query_avg_temp("India", 1, 12, 1990, 2010)
fig.show()
```

gives us:

## 6. Second Plot

The question :

> How do temperatures compare between specific stations between years in a country?

I thought this plot might be good to look at just to see how temperature compares between stations, and more interestingly how it changes throughout a number of years. A good exercise could be to create a geographic plot using the same data to better visualize it!

In order to answer this question, we will use a heat-map, with each tile of the heat-map corresponding to a station and its average temperature value in a given year.

So, we will need to obtain our data from the database and create our plot function as usual:

```python
import numpy as np #to use np.mean
import plotly.graph_objects as go # we use the graph_objects Heatmap plot

def query_station_heatmap(country, year_begin, year_end):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
   
    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.name, T.year, T.temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C on T.fips = C.fips
    WHERE C.country = "{country}" AND T.year >= {year_begin} AND T.year <= {year_end}
    """
   
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params = param) #Creates our dataframe
    
    df = df.groupby(["NAME", "Year"])["Temp"].aggregate(np.mean) #We aggregate mean data per station in a given year
    df = df.reset_index() #We reset indexing
    
    df_to_plot = df.pivot(index = "NAME" ,columns = "Year", values = "Temp") #Reshapes df such that we index by name,label each
                                                                            #column by year, and ea entry contain temp value
    
    #Then we plot with Plotly Graph Objects, 
    fig = go.Figure(data=go.Heatmap(
                   z=df_to_plot,
                   x=list(df_to_plot.reset_index())[1:], #Recall above that we made df_to_plot index by year, so we reset it to extract the values
                   y=df_to_plot.reset_index()["NAME"], #Same logic as above^
                   hoverongaps = False,
                   hovertemplate='Year: %{x}<br>Station Name: %{y}<br>Average Temperature (C): %{z}<extra></extra>')) # This changes the labelling from x : ___ to for example Year : ____ for the hover data

    fig.update_layout(
    title = f"Average Station Temperatures in {country} from {year_begin}-{year_end}",
    xaxis_title="Year", #Changes x-axis title
    yaxis_title="Station Name", #Changes y-axis title
    xaxis = dict(tickmode = 'linear', dtick = 1), #Makes sure we increment by whole years at a time
    width = 850, #Change the dimension of the plot for clarity
    height = 1250
)
```

Now that we have our query + visualization function written, it's time to see it action yet again. We will using Japan instead, taking values between 2017 and 2018! Below is the code + output to display the figure:

```python
fig = query_station_heatmap("Japan", 2017, 2018)
fig.show()
```

And thus concludes my blog post. I hope it was helpful!
