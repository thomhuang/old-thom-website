Although I have worked on it on a few more sessions after the <a href="/website/2021/12/25/first-day-working-on-the-website.html/" target="_blank">first post</a>, this will serve as an update for all of them.

### What I Accomplished

From the first "session" working, it was basically just laying the foundation and brainstorming things I wanted on the website, and the subsequent ones I feel were polishing and refining ideas/execution. So, to note a few things:

- Finishing the home page with all the information I'd like to add
    * Added ways to navigate to my `LinkedIn`, `GitHub`, `Resume`, and `Projects`.
- Changed the footer to include the website's repository and a little note instead of professional socials
-  Had photos redirect to recipes for all photos in the `Food` tab
- Added projects `collection` with short explanations and images of them

## Conclusion

No issues this time around, just need to work on being more efficient about my approach to figuring things out in `Jekyll`/`HTML`/`CSS` as some implementations definitely took longer than others. I do like where the website is at now and I just have to keep going strong.
