Inspired by the article above, I wanted to get myself comfortable with common problems given in interviews, and attempt to put in my own perspective. I will be continually updating this as I get more familiar with more difficult problems. So let us begin!

### Sliding Window

I am fairly comfortable with Sliding Window types of problems, and have even done an exploration of such a problem (check out my solution for the <href = “[https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)” target=”_blank”>Maximum Subarray problem</href>!).

Problems that are classified as “Sliding Window” have one thing in common, namely working within a data structure or type that has a linear data structure, or in other words, data structures in which the ordering matters! Examples of such data structures/types are arrays, linked lists, and strings. Common examples of such problems are  finding the maximum sum within subarrays, or maybe finding the longest subarray containing a specific value.
