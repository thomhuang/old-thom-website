In this post, I will discuss the properties, similarities, and differences between the three languages that I am most comfortable with with in the following order:

1. Python
2. C++
3. Java

At the end, I will provide a table of all the information provided to have a visual to understand their properties.

### Python

Python is an **interpreted language,** which means that the program we are running is sent to some **interpreter** (a program that executes other programs) ****that translates our code into machine code and executes line-by-line.

One downside to being an interpeted language is that it is often times slower as it must take the time to interpret and execute our code a line at a time, compared to **compiled languages**, that execute after compilation (we’ll later define compiled languages and compiling while discussing Java and C++ and why they are faster compared to Python).

Python is also a **dynamically typed language.** What we mean by this is that as we run our program, Python’s interpreter assigns types to our variables depending on what value is associated to such variables as we step through our program.

This is what allows us to not have to define our variable types when declaring, and is a large part of the appeal of Python, especially to beginners due to the simplicity and clean syntax ...
