I started working on my personal website "yesterday" (`12/24/2021`) and am probably at the end of the session. I will discuss the various things that I experienced and learned throughout the day just for future reference and as a process of learning.

### What I Accomplished

Today I sought out to just start the project in the first place, so the fact that we got to this point is a miracle. 

I was able to:

- Getting the `GitHub Pages` to work with `Jekyll`
- Secured a `.com` domain (<a href="http://www.thomaskhuang.com" target="_blank"> https://www.thomaskhuang.com </a>)
    * Connected the domain to the GitHub repository website
- Filled out header/footer/introduction with preliminary information + (hopefully) correct navigation
- Started the food pictures page
    * Allows user to "hover" over image and have it expand
    * User can click on some images to direct to the same, or a similar recipe
        + There are 3-4 working at the moment and I'm looking to get all of them done

### Issues

There were a lot of issues to begin with, and mostly with the packages necessary for `Jekyll`. I had to transfer information from a backup, and of course with the transfer of data things did not go perfectly. There were compatbility issues, version issues, etc. with packages and stuff and at that point I should have realized to reinstall everything bottom up instead of re-installing them one at a time.

This is also the first time that I am working with `HTML` and `CSS` to this extent, so there are the setbacks of learning something new, but we're at least making progress at least.

Other than the above, I don't think there were anything that were really setbacks that were notable.

## Conclusion

I'd definitely say a super productive day and I got a lot of ideas solidified and even implemented which is nice. A lot of changes and updates to come and I'm kinda motivated and excited for the future of this.
