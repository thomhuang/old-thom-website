        I am a third-year Applied Mathematics student at UCLA pursuing a minor in Statistics and a concentration in Computing. So far, I have have enjoyed working with machine learning, data cleaning/engineering, and algorithms in particular, and hope to work in Software Engineering or Data Science toward the future.
